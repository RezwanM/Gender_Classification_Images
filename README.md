# Gender_Classification_Images

This repository contains a python script that can classify genders based on images. The dataset used has more than 23000 images. Other labels which were not used include age and ethnicity. A simplified CNN model was used instead of the original architecture in order to speed up the training process on a local computer. The final model was trained on the combined training and validation set.
